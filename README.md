# PollsAppSE

This is a web application built for a school project.
It represents my first contact with Python and Django.

The objective of Polls is to create a web page containing, well, polls. This is very similar to the Facebook polls feature, where anyone could create a question and suggest answer for it, then other users could vote and the results are stored, to be displayed at the end of a given time period.

In order to build this, I have used Python and Django. The database of choice is SQLite, which was very convenient.
